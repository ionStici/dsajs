# Stacks

A [**Stack**](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms/tree/master/src/data-structures/stack) is a linear data structure which contains an ordered set ot data.

**Stacks** follow the "Last-In-First-Out" (LIFO) principles, meaning the element added last will be removed first.

A Stack is a linear collection of nodes that adds (pushes) data to one end of the data structure, and removes data (pops) from the same end of the data structure.

_Stacks provide three methods for interaction:_

- **Push** - adds data to the "top" of the stack
- **Pop** - returns and removes data from the "top" of the stack
- **Peek** - returns data from the "top" of the stack

## Stack Implementation

Stacks can be implemented using a linked list as the underlying data structure.

- The "top" of the stack is equivalent to the "head" node,
- The "bottom" of the stack is equivalent to the "tail" node.

_Optional Constraint:_ the stack size.

- Attempting to push data onto an already full stack will result in a **stack overflow**.
- If you attempt to pop data from an empty stack, it will result in a **stack underflow**.

Stacks are useful in various applications, such as managing function call stacks, evaluating expressions, and implementing algorithms like depth-first search.
